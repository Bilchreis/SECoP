SECoP Issue 26: More Module Meanings
====================================

Proposed new meanings: rotation_x, rotation_y, translation_x, translation_y, translation_z

Some problem is, that the exact meaning might differ.

As a general rule, we might say that '_regulation' can be postfixed to any menaing, if the quantity generating module is different from the (closer to the sample) relevant measuring device.
