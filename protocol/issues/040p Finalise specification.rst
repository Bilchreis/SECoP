SECoP Issue 40: Finalise Specification
======================================

Motivation
----------
The current specification looks a lot like a placeholder with lots of pointers to other documents.
Also many things are only tried to clarify by inserting *note* and *remark* snippets.

Proposal
--------
Finalise the specification by replacing all *note* snippets with a definition.

Discussion
----------
not discussed yet.
