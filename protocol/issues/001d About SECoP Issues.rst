SECoP Issue 1: About SECoP Issues
=================================

The idea behind SECoP Issues is to document properly what was proposed,
what was discussed, what was decided and why it was decided.

An issue might take different states:

(u) unspecified
---------------

a vague idea, but no proposal written down yet

(p) proposed
------------

A proposal should contain the motivation. As long as nobody else
joins into a discussion, the state remains *proposed*

(d) under discussion
--------------------

This state is kept until there is a decision taken.

(c) closed
----------

After a decision the state is *closed*. The issue is not deleted,
even if the decision was to not follow further the proposal.
This is helpful if somebody later rises a similar issue.
However, it should be possible to reopen an issue, if new
arguments arise.

(e) extensible
--------------

The main content of the issue is agreed, but it is containing a list
of confirmed and proposed items.
