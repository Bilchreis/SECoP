SECoP Issue 15: Support for Start/Stop/Pause/Shutdown Commands
==============================================================

Initially, only one command was predefined:

  * stop

From the ILL software group it is a wish to support the following
commands:

  * start
  * pause
  
In addition the following command was proposed

  * shutdown (meaning: go to safe state after finishing the experiment)
 
Discussion
----------

* What is the exact meaning of these commands?
* What is the difference of *stop* and *pause*?
* Is an interplay possible with the 2 worlds using/supporting or not the commands *start* and *pause*
