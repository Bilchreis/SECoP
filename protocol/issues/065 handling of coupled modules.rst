SECoP Issue 65: handling of coupled (sub)modules (unspecified)
==============================================================

Motivation
----------

Sometimes Modules 'interact' with the same physical 'output'.
Currently it is undefined on how to implement this, yet
having a defined standard way would greatly improve interoperability.

Several ideas exist, ranging from: 'put everything in one module and
add parameter selecting the main role' to 'make everything it's own module'.
In the latter case we would need:

1. a way to 'mark' the corresponding' modules (or group of modules?)
2. a defined way to 'switch over' the module in charge
3. a way to indicate, which module is 'in charge'

The only thing clear so far is that the content and meaning of the 'value' parameter should not be changed at runtime,
i.e. if it is defined to repesent a temperature, it will never 'be switched' to resistance or heater_power or anything else.
